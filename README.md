# Toy Robot

Toy Robot is a coding challenge commonly used as part of the interviewing process for software development roles. The challenge is to write an application that fits the following requirements:

- The toy robot is placed on a 5x5 table top.
- The toy robot cannot be placed outside these bounds and cannot be moved outside these bounds.
- The user can issue one of five commands to the robot: PLACE X,Y,F; MOVE; LEFT; RIGHT; REPORT.
- PLACE must be the first command used, since the other commands require the robot to be on the table already.
- PLACE X,Y,F will place the robot on the table at the coordinates given, facing in the direction specified (N, S, E or W).
- LEFT will turn the robot 90ยบ to the left.
- RIGHT will turn the robot 90ยบ to the right.
- MOVE will move the robot forward one unit, in whichever direction it is facing.
- REPORT will cause the robot to output its position and direction.
- In my example, I've also implemented an EXIT command to quit the application.

## Running the application

1. Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).
2. Clone the solution to your local machine.
3. Using a terminal, navigate to the `toy-robot` directory.
4. Run the application by typing `dotnet run`.

## Testing the application

1. Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).
2. Clone the solution to your local machine.
3. Using a terminal, navigate to the `toy-robot.tests` directory.
4. Run the unit tests by typing `dotnet test`.
